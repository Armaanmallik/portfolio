      <p>My hobby is reading interesting and knowledgeable books in my free time. Wheneer I go to home from my school I like to read such books after completing my home work. Iam 12 years old and I read a book in class 7th stsndard. Now I know that reading is a good habit which can make me complete. This hobby can be developed by anyone however I got this naturally. Reading books keep one always happy and busy. It is the good source of enjoyment, knowledge. inpiration and instruction. It makes us disciplined, loyal, punctual and most importantly a successful person in the life.
